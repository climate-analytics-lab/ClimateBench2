"""Command-line interface for ClimateBench2.

Installed as the ``climatebench2`` console script (see ``[project.scripts]``
in ``pyproject.toml``); also runnable as ``python -m climatebench2._cli``.

Subcommands
-----------
``climatebench2 score MODEL``
    Run the ClimateBench2 evaluation suites on a model's CMOR output via
    ClimateEval and write one DuckDB results database per suite (default:
    the CB2 tier suites, which grow per the delineation plan §6), then run
    the Tier II scoring pass over them (``--no-score`` skips it).
``climatebench2 leaderboard DB [DB ...]``
    Build the ClimateBench2 leaderboard from result databases;
    ``--rescore`` re-runs the Tier II scoring pass over them first.

The Tier II scores are a **post-processing pass**
(:mod:`climatebench2.scoring_pass`), not a diagnostic: ensemble members are
ingested as separate data sources, so a model's fair CRPS can only be formed
once every member has run. The pass is idempotent — it replaces the rows it
wrote before — so it is safe to re-run at any time.

ClimateBench2 deliberately has no data-loading or report machinery of its
own — ``score`` delegates to ClimateEval (``load_cmor_dir`` + ``Suite``), and
per-model interactive reports remain available via ``climateeval report``.

Each suite is fed the data *shape* and time window the protocol asks for
(:data:`SUITE_REGISTRY`), not one global slice of the submission:

- the Tier I / Tier II-events / Tier III suites take an **experiment dict**,
  whose ``historical`` entry is the model's own output loaded in **full** —
  the aerosol-era and Pinatubo diagnostics live in 1950–1993 and the
  clear-sky, ITCZ–EFE and hemispheric checks want the whole record. Tier I
  and Tier III run **once per model**; ``ClimateBench2_TierII_events`` runs
  **once per ensemble member** (``SuiteSpec.per_member``), each member
  supplying its own ``historical`` record, because its Tier II scalars —
  realized warming level, Pinatubo anomaly, hemispheric asymmetry — are
  scored across the ensemble by the fair-CRPS pass;
- ``ClimateBench2_TierI_variability`` (ENSO amplitude/spectrum) takes the
  **piControl** experiment in full — the paper asks for ≥ 100 yr of control;
- the Tier II suites take the model's cubes cut to the **post-2015 test
  window** (``tier2.test_window_start`` → ``<start>0101/<last complete
  year>1231``), which ``--timerange`` overrides explicitly. The monthly
  Tier II suite is then windowed **per suite entry**
  (:func:`materialise_windowed_suite`): its regime-(a) time-series entries
  reach back to the **baseline window's first year** (1985), because they
  are scored on anomalies about each source's own 1985–2014 climatology,
  while the EOF basis, the maps, the annual cycles and the zonal lines keep
  the test window. The submission's cubes are therefore loaded from 1985
  too; every diagnostic re-clips them to its own variable's ``timerange``.

    ``shape``
        ``"experiments"`` — an experiment dict (complex diagnostics), run once

    ``source``
        For cube suites: ``"model"`` (the submission, run once per ensemble

        ``--timerange`` overrides the first two but never ``"full"``, which
        is used where a window would destroy the statistic: a control run has
        its own calendar (``TierI_variability``), and the daily suite's
        extremes, PDFs and diurnal climatologies are defined by the paper
        over the **whole historical record** and labelled in-sample.
    ``per_member``

        for the cube suites (each member's series is its own data source, and
