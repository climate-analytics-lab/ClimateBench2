"""Packaged protocol data tables, and the staged CMIP6 comparison ensemble.

Anything a CB2 *score* needs that is neither a threshold nor a computation:
the annual effective-radiative-forcing series that drives the two-layer EBM
behind the pattern-scaling baseline (``erf_ar6_ssp245.csv``, read by
:func:`climatebench2.baselines.load_erf_series`).

Model output and observations never live here — they come from ClimateEval
DataSources (docs/climateeval_delineation_plan.md, the ownership test). Two
things that do:

* :class:`~climatebench2.data.cmip6_staged.StagedCMIP6HistoricalSSP245` — a
  *discovery policy*, not data: it finds the CMIP6 historical+SSP2-4.5
  comparison ensemble in a pre-staged root instead of globbing the pool, with
  the protocol's member policy and member cap applied at staging time. It
  yields ClimateEval data sources with ids identical to
  :class:`climateeval.data.CMIP6HistoricalSSP245`, which stays the documented
  alternative.
* :class:`~climatebench2.data.imerg.IMERG` — the daily-precipitation
  observational reference the paper's Table 2 names, which ClimateEval has no
  DataSource for. It is a plain :class:`climateeval.data.DataSource` over
  staged files and **belongs upstream**; it is here only because ClimateEval
  is a pinned dependency CB2 does not patch, and it is written so that moving
  it is a file copy.
