"""Tier II scoring diagnostics.

- :class:`ScoredAnnualMeanTimeSeries` / :class:`ScoredMonthlyMeanTimeSeries` /
  :class:`ScoredAnnualMaxTimeSeries` — the time-series diagnostics the Tier II
  suites name. They are **thin subclasses of the ClimateEval diagnostics**
  (``ScoredAnnualMaxTimeSeries`` additionally takes a per-gridpoint annual
  maximum before the area mean): they emit the raw series and ClimateEval's
  deterministic metrics, and nothing else.

  The probabilistic score is *not* computed here. Since ensemble members
  arrive as separate data sources (``--member`` / DRS discovery, one run per
  member), the fair CRPS across a model's members can only be formed once
  every member has run — so it is a post-processing pass over the finished
  database, :mod:`climatebench2.scoring_pass`, which ``climatebench2 score``
  runs after the suites and ``climatebench2 leaderboard --rescore`` can
  re-run. Scoring each source separately, as this module used to, made every
  model an M = 1 "ensemble" whose fair CRPS is undefined.

- :class:`InternalVariability` — the σ_int input of the regime-(c)
  consistency test: the piControl global-mean annual series of each core
  variable, chunked into observation-length segments
  (``scoring.chunked_statistic_std``) for the window **mean** and the OLS
  **trend**, at both window lengths the protocol scores (the post-2015 test
  window and the 1950-present window). It emits numbers, never a pass/fail —
  ``tier2.internal_variability.requirement`` is ``diagnostic``.

- :class:`TrendConsistency` — **now a thin alias** of the annual-mean series.
  The regime-(c) computation moved into
  :mod:`climatebench2.scoring_pass`, which is where the ensemble members
  (grouped by model name), the reference and — when the Tier I database is
  scored alongside — the σ_int rows of :class:`InternalVariability` all meet.
  Computed inside the diagnostic it could only pool the submission with the
  CMIP6 comparison *models*, whose spread is structural disagreement rather
  than the model's own ensemble spread, and σ_int was hard-wired to 0.

Metrics rows use the numeric-column convention of ``pass_fail``:
``value``/``passes`` plus score-specific columns.

    observation-length window, and the observational uncertainty
    (metrics_reference.md Tier II preamble (c)). This diagnostic supplies the
    middle term: for the global-mean **annual** series of each core variable
    it can find in the piControl experiment, it chops the control into
    non-overlapping segments of each scored window length and takes the
    inter-segment standard deviation of

    - the window **mean** (``..._sigma_int_mean_<window>``), and
    - the window **OLS trend** per year (``..._sigma_int_trend_<window>``),

    post-2015 window, ``tier2.test_window_start`` → last complete year) and
    ``long`` (``tier2.long_trend_start`` = 1950 → last complete year). The
    lengths themselves are emitted as ``window_years_<window>`` so the
    scoring pass can match a σ_int to the record it is actually scoring.
