"""Perfect-model (III.2): a held-out ESM run standing in for observations.

metrics_reference.md §III.2. The protocol's perfect-model test trains a
submission on one ESM's historical output, asks it to predict that ESM's
SSP2-4.5 future, and scores the prediction with the **Tier II machinery**
against the held-out truth run — isolating model skill from observational
uncertainty, which is the whole point (the truth is known exactly, so
σ_obs = 0).

The design that costs the least code (delineation plan §5) is to change
*nothing* about the Tier II diagnostics and swap only their reference: a
suite's ``reference_data:`` names a ``DataSource`` class, so pointing it at
the truth run makes every scored diagnostic run unchanged.
:class:`LocalCMORReference` is that DataSource — a thin adapter over
``climateeval._loader.load_cmor_dir``, which is what
``climatebench2 score`` already uses for the submission itself.

**Upstream candidate.** ClimateEval has no DataSource for "a local CMOR
directory": every one of its sources downloads and CMORizes a published
product. A generic ``LocalCMORDataSource(path, information)`` belongs
upstream next to ``ESMValToolCMORizerDataSource``, and this class is the
prototype for it — it adds no preprocessing of its own, it only resolves a
path and hands the cubes to ``get_prepared_cube`` exactly as the base class
does.

Configuring it
--------------
A suite YAML names a *class*, which ClimateEval instantiates with no
arguments, so the directories are registered on the module before the suite
is built::

    paths = configure_truth(Path("/data/CESM2/ssp245"), {"r2i1p1f1": ...})
    # -> ["climatebench2.diags.truth_reference.LocalCMORReference",
    #     "climatebench2.diags.truth_reference.TruthMember_r2i1p1f1"]

The first is the reference; the rest are the truth model's **other ensemble
members**, which enter ``other_data`` so the scoring pass can run the
large-ensemble spread test against the submission's own spread. Every one of
them is tagged ``category = "truth"``, which is how the pass tells a truth
run from a CMIP6 comparison model (it must never enter ``E_ref``) and how it
knows to label the rows ``window = perfect-model``.
