"""The Tier II scoring pass over a finished results database.

Why a pass and not a diagnostic
-------------------------------
Ensemble members are ingested as **separate data sources** (``--member`` /
DRS auto-discovery run every cube suite once per member, appending rows whose
``data_id``s differ only by ``variant``). A model's fair CRPS therefore can
only be formed once *all* of its members have run — which is after the suite,
not inside a diagnostic. This module is that post-processing step:
``climatebench2 score`` runs it on the databases it just wrote, and
``climatebench2 leaderboard --rescore`` re-runs it on existing ones. It is
also where the σ_int of the Tier I database meets the Tier II members, which
is why the regime-(c) consistency test lives here too.

What it computes (metrics_reference.md Tier II preamble, §II.0)
---------------------------------------------------------------
**Regime (a) — time series.** For every ``raw_output`` with a ``time``
column and a ``reference`` data source, and every variable in it:

1. group the non-reference rows **by model name** — the ``data_sources``
   table maps each ``data_id`` to ``(name, category)``, so the members of one
   model come back together, the CMIP6 comparison models stay apart, and an
   **observational product** (category ``observation``/``reanalysis`` sitting
   in ``other_data``, e.g. HadISST next to the ESACCI-SST reference) is never
   scored as if it were a comparison model;
2. stack a model's members on the times they share with the reference and
   score them with the **fair CRPS** per step (``M >= 2``; a single-member
   model gets a row with ``crps = NaN`` and ``reason = "single member"``,
   since fair CRPS is undefined for a deterministic forecast);
3. observational uncertainty enters as **common draws** around the observed
   series: σ_obs is the protocol floor for the variable
   (``tier2.obs_sigma``) combined in quadrature with the per-time-step
   **spread across observational products**, and every model and baseline
   sees the same draws (``tier2.obs_uncertainty.seed``);
4. summarise: time-mean score, ESS-corrected standard error, and a
   moving-block-bootstrap confidence interval (``tier2.bootstrap``);
5. add the **Climatology** baseline — the distribution of the reference's
   1985-2014 values for each calendar month. Those values are outside the
   test window the suite is cut to, so they come from the
   ``reference_baseline`` rows that
   :class:`climatebench2.diags.ReferenceBaselineRecord` writes — and, for a
   GMST-type annual series, the **PatternScaling** baseline: a two-layer EBM
   driven by the packaged ERF table with one parameter calibrated on the
   observations through 2014, displaced into pseudo-members by the detrended
   residuals of the baseline window;
6. set ``E_ref`` = **median of the per-model fair CRPS over the CMIP6
   comparison models** with ``M >= 2``, excluding any comparison model whose
   name equals the scored model's (leave-one-out, paper §5.6), and write the
   skill ``S = 1 - E_model / E_ref`` — bounded above, unbounded below.

**Aggregated scalars.** For a ``raw_output`` with **no time axis** — one
number per data source and ``var_id``, the shape a CB2 complex diagnostic
writes (``_scalar_outputs``) — plus ``reference`` rows carrying the observed
value of the same scalar, the same machinery runs with a single-point scoring
axis: fair CRPS of the members' values against the observation, ``E_ref`` and
the skill as elsewhere, and the regime-(c) consistency test with σ_int looked
up per scalar from ``tier2.scalar_consistency``. This is how the realized
warming level, the two GMST trends, the Pinatubo tas anomaly and the
hemispheric-asymmetry trend of §II.1 are scored.

**Regime (b) — spatial fields.** For a ``raw_output`` of EOF coefficients
(:class:`climatebench2.diags.ReferenceEOFProjection`: one row per source,
variable and mode on the reference's fixed pre-2015 basis, each coefficient
standardised by its pre-2015 σ), the same machinery runs with **mode** in
place of time: fair CRPS per coefficient, equal-weight mean over the
retained modes as the variable-level score, the same ``E_ref``/skill.

**Regime (c) — consistency.** For every annual series, one row per model:
the observed OLS trend against the distribution of its members' trends, with
σ_total² = var(members) + σ_int² + σ_obs² — σ_int from the piControl chunks
of :class:`climatebench2.diags.InternalVariability` (Tier I database, passed
alongside), σ_obs from the same observational-uncertainty terms as (a).

Every row also carries a ``window`` label — ``held-out`` or ``in-sample`` —
resolved from ``tier2.window_labels`` by (diagnostic, ``var_id``), which is
the paper's §5.6 scorecard rule: the leaderboard states, per entry, whether
the observations it was scored against predate the reserved test period.

Rows are appended to the diagnostic's own ``metrics`` table (never a new
schema): missing columns are added with ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``, and every
row carries ``scorer = "climatebench2"`` so a re-run deletes its predecessors
first and is idempotent.

The pooled ``CMIP6-MME`` row of earlier revisions is gone: a pooled
multi-model mixture is overdispersed (its spread is structural disagreement,
not internal variability), which inflates ``E_ref`` — the doc's ⚠ rules it
out in favour of the median of per-model scores.

    anomaly is taken per ``data_id`` — that is, per ensemble member, about
    *that member's* own climatology, not about the model's or the
    reference's. Scoring the absolute series instead makes the fair CRPS a
    statement about each field's mean-state bias: on the first full Tier II
    run CNRM-CM6-1's 1.1 K cold GMST bias alone gave CRPS ≈ 1.0 K and skill
    −2.85 with a perfectly reasonable post-2015 trajectory.

    The submission, the reference and every comparison member are treated
    identically. The reference may take its climatology from the
    ``reference_baseline`` rows when its own rows do not reach back (which
    is what an older, test-window-only database has), and those rows are
    shifted by the same offsets so the Climatology baseline stays in the
    same space.

    Only then is the table cut to ``tier2.test_window_start`` onwards: the

    When a database carries **truth members** — the truth model's own
    ensemble, ingested through ``other_data`` by ``score --truth-member`` —
    the submission's inter-member variability is compared with the truth
    ensemble's, for each variable of ``tier3.le_spread.variables``:

    (i) the **variance ratio** (predicted / true inter-member variance),
        gated at ``tier3.le_spread.variance_ratio_range`` — an Extended Tier
        III check, reported for credit and never part of the entry ticket;
    (ii) the **pattern correlation** of the two inter-member variance
         fields, reported without a bound (the paper sets none).

    Both come from :mod:`climatebench2.scoring`; this is only the plumbing
    that finds the two ensembles and writes the rows. On a *time-series*
    raw_output the remaining axis is time, so "pattern" is the shape of the
    spread through the record; the same two functions apply unchanged to a
    Map raw_output whose axis is space — only the stacking would differ, and
    the pass scores no Map today.

    ⚠ Never exercised on real data: CESM2 / MPI-ESM / GISS-E2 and CESM-LE
