"""Load a suite's reference and comparison ensemble ONCE for all members.

A per-member cube suite (``_cli.SuiteSpec.per_member``) runs once per
submission member, and every one of those runs used to re-load the suite's
``reference_data`` and its whole ``other_data`` comparison ensemble
(:class:`climatebench2.data.StagedCMIP6HistoricalSSP245`, 109-160 members)
from disk: ClimateEval's ``Suite.get_database`` rebuilds every diagnostic per
call, and ``SimpleDiagnostic.get_output`` calls ``DataSource.get_cube`` for
the reference and for each comparison source inside the run, with no cache.
Ten submission members meant ten reads of the ensemble — 1,190 daily ``pr``
loads for the held-out extremes entry, which timed out at 12 h twice
(2026-09-26/28).

Nothing about those two stages depends on the member. ``get_output`` runs

1. ``_get_reference_cubes()`` — load + preprocess every reference;
2. ``_get_output_of_reference_data(reference_cubes)`` — its raw-output rows;
3. ``_get_output_of_to_benchmark_data(data, info, reference_cubes)`` — the
   **member**;
4. ``_get_output_of_other_data(reference_cubes)`` — load + preprocess every
   comparison source, its raw-output rows and its metrics against the
   reference,

and only step 3 sees the member. So :func:`run_members` runs a per-member
suite **one diagnostic at a time**: it builds that diagnostic once, runs it
for every member, and memoises steps 1, 2 and 4 on the instance for the
duration. What is held is therefore

- the **preprocessed** reference cubes (step 1 realises them anyway), and
- the comparison sources' **raw-output / metrics tables** (step 4's output:
  one row of scalars, a ~25-year annual series or a histogram per source —
  kilobytes), never their cubes,

and it is dropped as soon as that diagnostic has seen its last member, so
the peak is the same reference cube a single ``get_output`` call already
held, plus the comparison tables of one diagnostic.

Running diagnostic-major rather than member-major writes the **same rows**:
each diagnostic writes its own DuckDB schema, and within a schema the
members are still inserted in order. Only the log order changes.

What is shared, and what is not
-------------------------------
A diagnostic is shared only when that cannot change a value:

- a ClimateEval ``SimpleDiagnostic`` that keeps upstream's ``get_output``
  (the four stages above) and has a reference or comparison source — every
  upstream simple diagnostic and every CB2 one built on them
  (``ScoredAnnualMeanTimeSeries``, ``ETCCDIExtremes``,
  ``AnnualExtremeIndexSeries``, ``PerkinsSkillScore``, ...);
- a CB2 diagnostic that opts in with a ``share_across_members()`` method and
  memoises its own member-invariant part (``ReferenceBaselineRecord``,
  ``ReferenceEOFProjection``, which override ``get_output``).

Anything else — a complex diagnostic, a simple one with its own
``get_output`` — is rebuilt for every member exactly as ``Suite.get_database``
did before, and ``--no-cache`` restores the old member-major loop for the
whole suite.

The upstream seam
-----------------
This lives here, not in ClimateEval, because ClimateEval is pinned and not
patched. It leans on two private details of ``climateeval.suites.Suite``
(``_suite_definition``, the parsed YAML list, and ``_get_diagnostics``) and
on the four ``SimpleDiagnostic`` stage methods above. The upstream change
that would make it unnecessary is small: let ``Suite.get_database`` accept
several ``(data, information)`` pairs (or keep its diagnostics across calls)
and memoise the reference/other stages per diagnostic.
